Description:    
    This add-on is currently the only way to analyze packet captures in splunk. 
    It is currently a simple collection of parsing transforms that understand 
    PDML output from Tshark (part of Wireshark).
    
    For more information on the PDML standard and the fieldnames generated by 
    this add-on, see the below address:

            PDMLSpec.htm
                    
================================================================================    
Using this Add-on
================================================================================
Place the application pdml directory in %SPLUNK_HOME%/etc/app
Place a pdml file in %SPLUNK_HOME%/var/spool/splunk
Run the below search:
    sourcetype="pdml" packet

================================================================================
Converting PCAPs to PDML for Splunk to index
================================================================================
The following command will use Tshark to convert a PCAP file to a PDML file
    'tshark -r FILENAME.PCAP -T pdml > FILENAME.PDML'

As packet captures can be large and indexing has a daily limit, it is 
recommended to filter out unnecessary packets before converting them to pdml and
indexing them into Splunk.
